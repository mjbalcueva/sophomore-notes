- Present a rich style in program; structure based on a **collection of stateful entities**
- Popular current representatives:
  - C++
  - Java
- An object-oriented design model
- Principle programming techniques
- Relation to other models:
  - Higher Order Programming
  - Component-based Programming:
    - Encapsulation
    - Compositionality
    - Instantiation
    - Inheritance
      - Can be built on **hierarchical structures** from data abstractions that depend on other data abstractions (**_Components_**)
      - The object style of data abstraction is the default, not the ADT style
      - Is based on the idea that data abstractions have much in common [e.g. Sequences(tasks)]
  - Functional Programming
- Case-study in obect-oriented language
