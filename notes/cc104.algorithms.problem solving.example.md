### Example

- Your roommate, who is taking Information Technology II class, is in a panic. He is worried that he might lose his financial aid if his average goes under 6.0

- How can he figure out what his current average is?

- How can you build a process that any student can use to tell them what average they have based on grades provided thus far?
